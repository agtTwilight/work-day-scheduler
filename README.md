# work-day-scheduler

## Description
The html and css for this project was provided by my bootcamp. I was assigned two tasks for this assignment: 1) to use jQuery and implement proper past, present, and future class assignment to each time block cell. 2) to save any data stored within the time block cells to local storage, retrieve the data on page reload, and append the data to the correct cell. Try it out yourself by adding some ToDo's, clicking the save button, and reloading the page!

## Tutorial
Watch the following gif (note, after I delete the data from a cell, I am reloading the page and the previously saved data is being pulled from local storage)!
